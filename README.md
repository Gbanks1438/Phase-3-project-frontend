ABOUT:
This app was a way for me to explore making an Airbnb style of app for my family members and friends to "time-share" a single vacation property. Users can schedule when they wish to use the vacation property to avoid conflicts with each other. The website is intended to also show details about the rooms and amenities, as well as available activities, and local businesses. The concept is to make planning a visit easy, even with a large group. My family owns a vacation property that I felt this idea could be applied to, so this was my first attempt at building a site for them. As I grow as a developer and strengthen my skills I hope to professionally build them a website to manage the property in real time.

My frontend is built using Javascript and React V6 for the functionality, and I used HTML with vanilla CSS for the layout and styling. The information about the property and things to do around town are hard coded. There is no log-in security in this iteration of the website concept. I did not make a Monorepo for this project so the frontend and backend are separate repositories. This app is not hosted on Heroku currently. Please pull down a forked copy locally and use the instructions below to launch the website in your browser if you would like to see more details. 


HOW TO USE:
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
